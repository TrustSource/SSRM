# TrustSource User's Guidance to SSRM

This repo contains a detailed description of the measures, responsibilities and organisations undertaken to ensure a secure and uninterrupted operation of TrustSource solution. Besides explaining what TrustSource does, it also outlines the reponsibilities of the TrustSource customer and indicates where to find additional support to cope with these challenges.

The guide itself is continuously updated to keep pace with the change. However, it will carry a version number and older versions will be kept for later reference. To get an idea of the changes and updates a CHANGELOG is maintained.

This solution is built on top of MKDocs by [Martin Donath](https://github.com/squidfunk).
