# SSRM Guidance for TrustSource Users

The Shared Security Responsibility Model (SSRM) is (explain)

## The Shard Security Responsibility

TrustSource helps in providing Security and Compliance for Software Applications. In scope of this, TrustSource itself has the aim to be secure und compliant as well. TrustSource has a strong set of security policies to achieve this. In short, we will even provide these policies publicly to a certain extent. This will support what we call **Security of the Application**
However, to provide a secure solution, it is not only done with a secure application. Also the use of the application comes with a certaiin responsibility, which we call **Security in the Application**.
This document outlines these two aspects and clarifies the responsibility of each side.
