# EOS Responsibilities

In this section we will outline our responsibilities and the measures we implement to cope with them. 

## Overview of our Responsibilities

TrustSource sees it as its responsibility 

## Our Responsibility Sharing

To provide TrustSource at an affordable subscritpion price, we operate it on AWS. Thus we rely partly on then prefessionalism our 3rd party certified partner AWS brings to the table when it comes to provide datacenter services. A detailed description of how this s organised can be found in [this document](!https://).
In addition we use MongoDB, who is providing us with Cluster and Database management software. The clusters are operated by us on top of our AWS infrastructure without Mongo having access to neither their code nor teh data.
